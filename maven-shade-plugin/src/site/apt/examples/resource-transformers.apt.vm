Resource Transformers

  Aggregating classes/resources from several artifacts into one uber JAR is straight forward as long as there is no
  overlap. Otherwise, some kind of logic to merge resources from several JARs is required. This is where resource
  transformers kick in.

* Merging Plexus Component Descriptors

  JARs for components targeting the Plexus IoC container contain a <<<META-INF/plexus/components.xml>>> entry that
  declares the component and its requirements. If the uber JAR aggregates multiple Plexus components, a
  <<<ComponentsXmlResourceTransformer>>> needs to be used to merge the XML descriptors:

+-----
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>shade</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <transformers>
                <transformer implementation="org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.ComponentsXmlResourceTransformer"/>
              </transformers>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----

  Since plugin version 1.3, this resource transformer will also update the descriptor to account for relocation of
  component interfaces/implementations (if any).

* Concatenating Service Entries

  JAR files providing implementations of some interfaces often ship with a <<<META-INF/services/>>> directory that
  maps interfaces to their implementation classes for lookup by the service locator. To merge multiple implementations
  of the same interface into one service entry, the <<<ServicesResourceTransformer>>> can be used:

+-----
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>shade</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <transformers>
                <transformer implementation="org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.ServicesResourceTransformer"/>
              </transformers>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----

* Merging Content of Specific Files

  Some jars contain additional resources (such as properties files) that have the same file name. To avoid overwriting, you can
  opt to merge them by appending their content into one file. One good example for this is when aggregating both the spring-context 
  and plexus-spring jars. Both of them have the <<<META-INF/spring.handlers>>> file which is used by Spring to handle XML schema 
  namespaces. You can merge the contents of all the files with that specific name using the <<<AppendingTransformer>>> as shown below:
  
+-----
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>shade</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <transformers>
                <transformer implementation="org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.AppendingTransformer">
                  <resource>META-INF/spring.handlers</resource>
                </transformer>
                <transformer implementation="org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.AppendingTransformer">
                  <resource>META-INF/spring.schemas</resource>
                </transformer>
              </transformers>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+----- 

  For XML files, you can use the <<<XmlAppendingTransformer>>> instead:

+-----
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>shade</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <transformers>
                <transformer implementation="org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.XmlAppendingTransformer">
                  <resource>META-INF/magic.xml</resource>
                  <!-- Add this to enable loading of DTDs
                  <ignoreDtd>false</ignoreDtd>
                  -->
                </transformer>
              </transformers>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+----- 

  Since plugin version 1.3.1, the <<<XmlAppendingTransformer>>> will by default not load DTDs, thereby avoiding network
  access. The potential downside of this mode is that external entities cannot be resolved which could fail the
  transformation, e.g. when using the Crimson XML parser as used in some JRE 1.4. If the transformed resource uses
  external entities, DTD resolution can either be turned back on or a plugin dependency on <<<xerces:xercesImpl:2.9.1>>>
  is added to the POM.
