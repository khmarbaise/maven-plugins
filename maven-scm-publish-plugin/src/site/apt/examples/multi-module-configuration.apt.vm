Maven Multi Module Configuration

  With a multi modules build you can not use: mvn site-deploy. You must stage your site first.

  Cli to use: <<mvn clean site site:stage-deploy scm-publish:publish-scm>>

+-----------------------

  <properties>
    <siteContentPath>${user.home}/my-site-deploy</siteContentPath>
    <scmCheckoutPath>${user.home}/my-site-content</scmCheckoutPath>
    <siteDeployUrl>file://${siteContentPath}</siteDeployUrl>
  </properties>

  <plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-scm-publish-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
    <configuration>
