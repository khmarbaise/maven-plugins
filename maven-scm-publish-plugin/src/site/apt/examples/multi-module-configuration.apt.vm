Maven Multi Module Configuration

  With a multi modules build, you cannot use: <<<mvn site-deploy>>>. You must stage your site first.

  Cli command to use: <<<mvn -Preporting site site:stage>>> then <<<mvn scm-publish:publish-scm>>>

+-----------------------

  <properties>
    <!-- override the property in your settings -->
    <site.mainDirectory>${user.home}</site.mainDirectory>
    // it's a default location for performance reason (avoid checkout the content on every build)
    // you can override this value in your settings.
    <scmCheckout.path>${site.mainDirectory}/$\{project.artifactId}</scmCheckout.path>
  </properties>
